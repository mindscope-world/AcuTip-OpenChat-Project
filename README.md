2. Select a cryptocurrency from the dropdown (BTC, ETH, or ICP)
3. Click "Submit"
4. The bot will respond with the current price:
   ```
   💰 Current BTC price: $93867.00
   ```

### Setting Price Alerts
1. Type `/alert set` in the chat
2. Fill in the alert details:
   - Select cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, or ICP)
   - Enter target price (e.g., 80000)
   - Choose condition (above/below)
3. Click "Submit"
4. The bot will confirm:
   ```
   🔔 Price alert set for BTC when price falls below $80000.00
   ```

### Managing Alerts
1. List your alerts:
   ```
   /alert list
   ```
   Response shows all active alerts:
   ```
   📋 Your Price Alerts:
   • BTC below $80000.00 (set 2024-04-30 17:59)
   ```

2. Remove an alert:
   ```
   /alert remove BTC
   ```
   Bot confirms:
   ```
   ✅ Removed price alert for BTC
   ```

### DEX Monitoring
1. Monitor whale movements:
   ```
   /dex whale
   ```
   Shows large transactions:
   ```
   🐋 Whale Alert!
   • 1000 ICP moved on Sonic DEX
   • 500 ETH swapped on Uniswap
   • 10 BTC transferred to exchange
   ```

2. Check liquidity:
   ```
   /dex liquidity
   ```
   Shows current liquidity:
   ```
   💧 Liquidity Update
   • Sonic DEX: 1M ICP
   • Uniswap: 500K ETH
   • PancakeSwap: 100K BNB
   ```

### Best Practices
- Set reasonable price alert thresholds
- Use the list command to manage multiple alerts
- Monitor DEX activities for market insights
- Remove unused alerts to keep your list clean

## Usage

1. Start the bot:
```bash
cargo run
```

2. Available Commands:
   - Check cryptocurrency prices:
     ```
     /price BTC
     ```

     ```
     /alert set BTC 80000 below
     ```
   - Monitor DEX activities:
     ```
     /dex whale
     /dex liquidity
     ```
